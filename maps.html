                <h3>CTF-Face</h3>
                <p>"This ancient asteroid has been converted to an Arena for the Tournament. It is highly dangerous due to aberrant gravitational properties and, of course, the snipers from the other team."</p>

                <h3>DM-Deck16</h3>
                <p>"Interstellar Space Vehicle Gaetano is the largest space-faring vehicle ever built. When in drydock, it serves as a venue for tournament combat. All battles take place on the infamous Deck 16 of the cruiser. Try to stay out of the slime!"</p>

                <h3>DM-Outpost23</h3>
                <p>"The Outland Territories are notoriously hostile due to their rugged landscape and sheer distance from colonized space. They're also renowned for being extremely rich in rare mineral deposits, so the Liandri Mining Corporation established a series of remote Outposts to collect and refine resources, despite the initial cost in human capital."</p>

                <h3>DM-Morpheus</h3>
                <p>"LMC knew they had found an excellent arena at the very top of a newly constructed Galaxyscrapper Super Structure. Thanks to the modern miracle of super tensile solids, these three buildings reach a staggering 12 miles high at their pinnacle. The thin atmosphere and reduced influence of Earth’s gravity provide an interesting test of the tournament athlete’s ability to adapt and conquer in extreme environments."</p>

                <h3>DM-HyperBlast</h3>
                <p>"Thanks to Magnetic Anti-Vacuum Resonance technology, combatants are able to battle outside of Xan’s ‘HyperBlast’ ArenaShip for an extended period of time. Use extreme caution though, one mistake and you’ll find yourself floating in space."</p>

                <h3>DM-Phobos</h3>
                <p>"This Martian space station is caught between Mars and its satellite Phobos, resulting in a chaotic rotation. Fortunately, the gravity generators are working well enough to lend a fast paced rhythm to deathmatch."</p>
